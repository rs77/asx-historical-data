# ASX Historical Stock & Options Data

A personal hobby project to collect and collate historical Australian Stock Market data from various public websites.

As a project I thought to try my hand at collecting data from various sources on the Internet using my growing Python skills. 

If you'd like to add additional data feel free to submit a pull request.
